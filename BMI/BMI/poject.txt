Project ONE
Your task is to write a program that reads records, prints the records, and computes some statistics. The program starts by asking for a threshold BMI. Only records with a BMI greater than or equal to the threshold will be printed. Each record consists of a person's name (which might contain spaces), weight in kilograms, height in centimeters (not meters), and the person's sex ('M' or 'F'). Let the user enter the sex in uppercase or lowercase.
Print each person's BMI after reading that person's record.
After collecting information for everyone, print two tables of the information.
One table is for men and the other is for women.
Mark records for which the BMI meets or exceeds the threshold with an asterisk after the BMI.
After each table, print the mean (average) and median BMI. (Median is the value such that half the BMI values are less than the median and half are greater than the median. If the user enters an even number of records, take the average of the two values in the middle.) Compute individual BMI values as integers. Compute the mean and median BMIs as floating point numbers, and print the mean with one place after the decimal point.
Body-mass index is defined as weight in kg/(height in m)2, converted to a unitless number.

Functions
int 
compute_bmi (int height, int weight)
 
Compute the body-mass index (BMI). The height is in centimeters, so the computed value is off by 10,000. Integer division truncates, but we want to round off to nearest, so add 0.5 and then truncate by casting to an integer.
 
void 
skip_line ()
 
Skip the rest of the input line.
 
bool 
get_record (std::vector< std::string > &names, std::vector< int > &heights, std::vector< int > &weights, std::vector< char > &sexes)
 
Get a single person's record. Store the name, height, weight, and sex in the supplied vectors.
 
void 
print_table (char sex, std::vector< int > const &heights, std::vector< int > const &weights, std::vector< int > const &bmis, std::vector< char > const &sexes, std::vector< std::string > const &names, int threshold)
 
Print a table. Print a table of height, weight, sex, BMI, and name. Print only records for which sex matches sex. At the end of each table, print the mean and median BMI.
 
int 
main ()
 
Main program to compute BMI.
 

Detailed Description
Compute body-mass index.
Function Documentation

int compute_bmi
(
int 
height,


int 
weight 

)


Compute the body-mass index (BMI). The height is in centimeters, so the computed value is off by 10,000. Integer division truncates, but we want to round off to nearest, so add 0.5 and then truncate by casting to an integer.
Parameters
height
The person's height in centimeters.
weight
The person's weight in kilograms.
Returns
the person's BMI, rounded to an integer

bool get_record
(
std::vector< std::string > & names,
std::vector< int > & heights,
std::vector< int > & weights,
std::vector< char > & sexes 
)
Get a single person's record. Store the name, height, weight, and sex in the supplied vectors.
Parameters
names
array of persons' full names
heights
array of height in centimeters
weights
array of weight in kilograms
sexes
array of persons' sex: 'M' means male and 'F' means female
Returns
true to continue reading records or false to stop

void print_table
(
char 
sex,


std::vector< int > const & 
heights,


std::vector< int > const & 
weights,


std::vector< int > const & 
bmis,


std::vector< char > const & 
sexes,


std::vector< std::string > const & 
names,


int 
threshold 

)


Print a table. Print a table of height, weight, sex, BMI, and name. Print only records for which sex matches sex. At the end of each table, print the mean and median BMI.
Parameters
sex
the sex to match
heights
the array of heights
weights
the array of weights
bmis
the array of BMIs
sexes
the array of sexes
names
the array of names
threshold
print only elements for which BMI > this
